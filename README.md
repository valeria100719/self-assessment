# self-assessment

It was very difficult to participate in this final project.


This difficulty was not due to the fact that coding was difficult, but to the lack of communication in the Group.

Unfortunately I believe that the group was male formed, lack of communication, or "delivery times" not respected.

Complete lack of organization, a point to change the theme of the project one week after the final delivery.

For my part I tried to dare a structure to the page on github, I started to work on coding, I gave a visual image to their "no data".

I'm sorry I didn't enjoy the project better.

We work on a progect about IRS Migration on the bases of house costing, me and Adam took care of the majority of coding and data analysis, Bob load the csv data and Dillon present the data.
