## self_assessment

As a team member, my role was the developer of the project, but I also did a significant amount of work in various areas. The team did not follow the strict division of roles indicated in each challenge, we tried to work in a harmonious and non-stressful way. Communication with the team was not easy due to missed deadlines and data analysis that did not take place on time, I collaborated in the process of reducing the characteristics and conducted the final comparisons of the model, I analyzed the data using R, cleaned the originals and created the first draft of the graphic representations with tableau.
There is really no aspect of the project that I haven't had a role in in some way. As for my biggest personal challenge through this project, I suspect it might be managing effective communication together with each team member.


## Team Assessment

We used various media and models for our team's communication protocols. Our primary communication was on "Slack", we used Tuesday and Thursday as meetings to plan the week's goals. We also had a lot of impromptu calls. Once a model was established for working and communicating well together, another challenge faced by our group included the technical aspect of choosing the best model. During the project we changed the data and the perspective of the project several times, I must say that not all members of the group were able to contribute constructively to the project, some worked on it only during meetings, others limited themselves to upload files .Fortunately, the group was also made up of people capable of analyzing data and creating a story. As for the strengths of our group, I think we haven't had many.

## Summary of the Project

The main objective of our project was to establish the causes of the migratory flow in the USA. According to our hypothesis, the standard of living could influence migration.The analysis was conducted by analyzing the IRS data of the last 5 years, the cleaned and analyzed data were plotted and graphed. The results show a positive migration from the coasts to the center of the country.This analysis could be improved and analyzed better if different aspects such as lifestyle, labor costs, and even the Covid that certainly influenced migration in 2020 were taken into consideration.
